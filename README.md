Crude replication of Ethnic IA name classification

 - name_classifiers.ipynb is the original, simple logistic regression model that I had used as a proof-of-concept, yielding an F1 Score of .79
 - ethnicia_replication.ipynb is the minimal implementation of the model described in the paper, yielding an F1 Score of .84 on the same dataset. Note that this is not a full replication and is on the Orissa caste dataset while the paper used an American voter files from three states.
